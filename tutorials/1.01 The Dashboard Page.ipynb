I'd recommend skimming it to get familiar with a few of the features, and then coming back later when you need something specific and you're not sure where to find it. Almost every experienced user of Jupyter knows all this stuff, but they didn't learn it from a guide, they learned because eventually they needed to do each of these things and they had to figure it out. Having this guide will make that a little smoother, but it'd be wasted effort to memorize everything here, you'll learn it naturally as you use Jupyter"
